Level Converter
===============

A bi-directional level converter. Place this between a 5V microcontroller, and 3.3V modules.
Uses a voltage regulator to convert the 5V from the microcontroller to 3.3, and mosfets to convert
all eight signals.

This is a half-sized module. There is also a full sized module, which uses regular axial resistors, instead of the
9 pin resistor networks used by this module. The choice is yours!

Headers
=======

Another half-sized module, which exposes each data pin in a triple header, with VCC and GND.
This is particularly useful for servos.

At the time of writing I haven't tested these modules.
