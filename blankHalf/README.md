I used this as a template for half-sized boards.
To keep costs low, I combine two half sized boards into one design, and have both printed
as if it were one board.

I have a router, which I can do my own V cuts, but its also easy to cut the boards using a sharp knife,
a little patience and brute force to snap them in two.
