Prototype
=========

I plan to use these to create one-off custom modules.
For example, I'll use one for an I2C real-time clock.

The long rows near the top are power rails VIN, VCC and GND.

The left-most column is connected to the input's data lines.

The right-most column is connected to the output's data lines.
If the solder bridges are soldered, then the outputs will be the same as the inputs.

The top and bottom of the board have options for additional standard connectors.

The remaining pads are unconnected.

## Soldering Notes

There are solder bridges on the back, which allow the data pins to pass through to the opposite side.
Unless you use the opposite side for something else, I recommend soldering these bridges.
