Pots
====

Contains four potentiometers. Connect to the Analog conntor of the main module.

Use jumpers on the center pins to select which pots are enabled.
For example to enable all four pots to the top four pins, add jumpers from the middle to the right.
To enable them to the bottom four pins, move the jumpers to the left.

## Notes

I use jumpers with long handles, which are easier to use.

### Version 1.0

Works fine. I see no need for a future version ;-)
