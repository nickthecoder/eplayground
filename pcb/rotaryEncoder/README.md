Rotary Encoder
==============

Houses two rotary encoders, with a push button.

There are 6 pull-up resistors.

Add jumpers to enable each encoder.

## Version History

## Version 1.0

Works fine (though I haven't used the push buttons yet).

## Version 1.1

Consider moving the encoders to the right slightly, leaving more space for the jumpers.
