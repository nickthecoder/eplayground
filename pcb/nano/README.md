Nano
====

A simple module, with a socket for an Arduino Nano.

There are three standard connectors, in the same configuration as the Pro-Mini and DIYDuino modules.

## Notes

Powered from USB only.

## Version History

### Version 1.0

This was the first "main" module. It works beautifully.
I've beed using it a lot to test the example code in my [https://github.com/nickthecoder/abstractIO](Abstract IO) project.

### Version 1.1

Not printer (or tested)

Added labels above A4 and A5 to hint that these are also used on the Serial connector.
