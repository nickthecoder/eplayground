Buttons
=======

8 buttons with pull-up resistors.

Header pins allow jumpers to be added to enable each button individually.

This was the first module that I had professionally printed.

## Notes

I used thicker tracks were possible, whereas later modules only used thicker tracks for power.

## Version History

### 1.0

In the earlist version of this project, I had an addition 3.3V pin on the "stadard" connector.
I've since done away with it.

Its quite easy to "bodge" these old boards to conform to the new standard, but the boards
don't line up nicely (they are half a pin pitch out).

### 1.1

Not printed.

Removed the 3.3V pin from the input and output connectors.
