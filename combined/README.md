Combined
========

To keep costs down, I combined 5 modules into 1 10x10cm board, and manually V-groved them using a router.

Includes a 4 button module which I no longer use (the 8 button version is much better).

At the time of writing this, I still haven't tested the DIYduino module.

The "out" directory contains the gerber files I sent off for printing.
